# PicoyPlacaPredictor

Write a "Pico y Placa" predictor. 
The inputs should be a license plate number (the full number, not the last digit. e.g. PBX-1234), a date (as a String), and a time. 
The program should return whether or not that car can be on the road.


Pico y Placa is used in Quito according to the number of plate and the last digit, 
that is to say that Monday can not circulate with your car the plates that end in 1 and 2, 
Tuesday will be 3 and 4, Wednesday is 5 and 6, Thursday 7 and 8, Friday is and 9 and 0, 
Saturdays and Sundays can circulate all

In this program you can place in the 3 boxes, 
in the first one will go the plate number that will consist of 3 numbers and the 4 digits of the plate in the PPP-1234 format, 
on the date you must place the date in the format dd / mm / yyyyyy, 
and at the time you must place in hh / mm format
